Welcome to my blog! I'm Chris D., but I usually go by my online alias, Mani. As an enthusiast of programming, mathematics, and anime, I've created this blog to share my passions and discoveries with you.

Here are some interesting facts about me:

- I dual boot linux, namely [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

- My favorite text editor is [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), check out my neovim (and other configs) in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/sogood99/dotfiles).

- My favorite theorem is probably [Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem), 2nd favorite is probably [Stokes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem).

  $$
  \int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_{M} \text{d}\omega
  $$

- I really enjoy foundational mathematics (eg. Set Theory, ZFC, and the alike), and I also enjoy [Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), that is why I am currently learning (in my spare time) [Homotopy Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory).

- I am a fan of JPOP, and my favorite band is [ZUTOMAYO(ずっと真夜)](https://open.spotify.com/artist/38WbKH6oKAZskBhqDFA8Uj?si=OQEXOwW0QxOfdhUuK5NPEQ). Check out this certified hood classic:

- My favorite anime is [Bocchi the Rock!(ぼっち・ざ・ろっく！)](https://anilist.co/anime/130003/Bocchi-the-Rock/)
