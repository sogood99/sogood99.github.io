After writing the last blog on how to setup a Linux Kernel Development environment, I realized I haven't written how I've setup Neovim with coc.nvim in NixOS.

## What is Neovim

Neovim is a powerful and extensible text editor. Neovim is a fork of Vim7. One of its strengths is its support for plugins that enhance its functionality. Coc.nvim is one such plugin that brings powerful language server protocol (LSP) support to Neovim, making it an excellent choice for programming and text editing tasks.

## Neovim in NixOS

First, we list `neovim` as one of the packages, eg.

```nix
{
  # ...
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # ...
    nodejs
  ];
  # ...
}
```

If you would like to get `clangd`, `rust-analyzer`, and `java` language server, remember to add the following:

```nix
      clang_16
      clang-tools_16
      jdk
```

## Neovim Configurations

### Install Vim-Plug

Simply run the following command to install `Vim-Plug`, a plugin manager.

```bash
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
```

### Init.vim

Open the `Neovim` configuration file. This is typically located at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`, create one if it doesn't exist.

Inside `init.vim`, add in the `coc-nvim` plugin:

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugged')
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}

call plug#end()
```

Save and run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugin. Then run `:CocConfig` which changes `coc-settings.json`, to make `clangd` and `rust-analyzer` work, we need to add the following:

```json
{
  "clangd.path": "/etc/profiles/per-user/yourusername/bin/clangd",
  "rust-analyzer.server.path": "/etc/profiles/per-user/yourusername/bin/rust-analyzer"
}
```

I also usually add format file on save setting:

```json
{
  "coc.preferences.formatOnSaveFiletypes": ["*"]
}
```
